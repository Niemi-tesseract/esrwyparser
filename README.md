# esrwyparser
Euroscope RWY file parser

This was designed to allow people to set up the prefered runways in euroscope for airports within a FIR, or use their already setup sectorfile to export prefered runway configurations. 
My intention is to use this to created prefered runway configurations much easier for our read-the-docs based airport documentation, at docs.rovacc.ro

Currently, the RWY file is parsed, and output as output in JSON format.
